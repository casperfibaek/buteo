# Module Refactoring Guide: Phased Approach

## Purpose
This document provides a structured, phase-by-phase approach to refactoring modules in the Buteo library. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a methodical workflow for improving code quality, functionality, and maintainability. This guide is designed to be followed sequentially by both human developers and AI assistants.

## Target Goals
- Improve overall code quality and maintainability
- Ensure files are no longer than ~700 lines of code
- Achieve complete documentation with type hints
- Reach 100% test coverage
- Follow consistent API design patterns

## Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

### 1.1 Module Overview Analysis
- [ ] Identify the module's core purpose and functionality
- [ ] Map out current API structure and dependencies
- [ ] Document existing public interfaces and their usage patterns
- [ ] Review current file structure and organization

### 1.2 Gap Analysis
- [ ] Compare module against similar libraries/tools to identify missing features
- [ ] Check that the module provides all functionality an end user would reasonably expect
- [ ] Identify functionality that is counterintuitive or violates principle of least surprise
- [ ] List potential improvements to API design for intuitiveness and consistency

### 1.3 Technical Debt Identification
- [ ] Run initial static analysis (pylint, mypy, pylance) to quantify issues
- [ ] Identify areas with missing or outdated documentation
- [ ] Note areas with missing or insufficient tests
- [ ] List any performance concerns or known bottlenecks

### 1.4 Refactoring Plan Creation
- [ ] Create a prioritized list of changes needed
- [ ] Determine if module should be split into smaller submodules
- [ ] Plan API changes (if any) and migration strategy
- [ ] Estimate effort required for each component of refactoring

## Phase 2: Code Structure Improvement

### 2.1 File Organization
- [ ] Split large files (>700 LOC) into logical, focused modules
- [ ] Ensure clear separation of concerns between files
- [ ] Optimize import structure and dependency relationships
- [ ] Create missing `__init__.py` files if needed

### 2.2 Function and Class Refactoring
- [ ] Rename functions/methods to follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Extract repeated code into utility functions
- [ ] Break down large functions into smaller, focused functions
- [ ] Apply appropriate design patterns to improve structure

### 2.3 API Refinement
- [ ] Standardize parameter ordering and naming across related functions
- [ ] Create proper function overloads where appropriate
- [ ] Ensure consistent return types and error handling
- [ ] Implement deprecation notices for any API changes

## Phase 3: Documentation and Type Safety

### 3.1 Type Hints Implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive type hints to all functions and parameters
- [ ] Utilize appropriate container types (List, Dict, Tuple, etc.)
- [ ] Create custom TypedDict or dataclass objects where appropriate
- [ ] Remove custom runtime type checking in favor of static type hints

### 3.2 Documentation Enhancement
- [ ] Add/update docstrings in numpydoc format for all public interfaces
- [ ] Include usage examples in docstrings for complex functions
- [ ] Document parameters, return values, and raised exceptions
- [ ] Add module-level docstrings explaining purpose and usage patterns

### 3.3 Type Validation
- [ ] Implement beartype validation for all public-facing functions
- [ ] Ensure consistent error messages for type validation failures
- [ ] Add appropriate runtime checks for values (not types) where needed

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization

### 4.1 Analysis
- [ ] Profile code to identify performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Measure memory usage patterns
- [ ] Identify CPU-intensive operations
- [ ] Benchmark current performance for key operations

### 4.2 Algorithmic Improvements
- [ ] Review and optimize algorithm efficiency
- [ ] Eliminate redundant calculations
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate
- [ ] Consider numerical stability and precision issues

### 4.3 Parallelization and Optimization
- [ ] Identify opportunities for parallelization
- [ ] Implement vectorized operations where possible
- [ ] Optimize memory usage and garbage collection
- [ ] Consider JIT compilation for critical paths (e.g., numba)

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

### 5.1 Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up proper fixtures in conftest.py
- [ ] Create test data generators for comprehensive testing
- [ ] Implement parametrized tests for edge cases
- [ ] Ensure test isolation and independence

### 5.2 Test Coverage Expansion
- [ ] Create/update unit tests for all functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests for module interactions
- [ ] Add explicit tests for edge cases and failure scenarios
- [ ] Ensure 100% test coverage across the module

### 5.3 Test Verification
- [ ] Verify all tests pass consistently
- [ ] Check test performance and optimize slow tests
- [ ] Ensure tests are meaningful (not just for coverage)
- [ ] Validate that tests properly verify the expected behavior

## Phase 6: Quality Assurance

### 6.1 Static Analysis
- [ ] Run and resolve pylint issues
- [ ] Fix mypy type checking issues
- [ ] Ensure compliance with project coding standards

### 6.2 Error Handling Review
- [ ] Verify all exceptions are appropriately caught and handled
- [ ] Ensure informative error messages
- [ ] Check resource management (file handles, memory, etc.)
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup in error scenarios

### 6.3 Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Test with invalid inputs
- [ ] Verify behavior with empty data, zero values, etc.
- [ ] Check performance with large datasets
- [ ] Ensure thread safety if applicable

## Phase 7: Final Review and Integration

### 7.1 Comprehensive Review
- [ ] Conduct code review with team members
- [ ] Verify all checklist items are complete
- [ ] Check for consistency across the module
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility or document breaking changes

### 7.2 Documentation Update
- [ ] Update examples to reflect changes
- [ ] Create/update tutorial documentation
- [ ] Ensure README and high-level docs reflect changes
- [ ] Add changelog entries

## Implementation Guidelines for AI Agents

When implementing this refactoring plan, AI agents should:

1. **Maintain context**: Keep track of the overall structure and purpose of the module being refactored
2. **Make incremental changes**: Focus on one section or file at a time
3. **Verify at each step**: Run tests after each significant change
4. **Document reasoning**: Explain the rationale behind structural changes
5. **Follow existing patterns**: Maintain consistency with the rest of the codebase
6. **Preserve behavior**: Ensure functional equivalence unless explicitly changing behavior
7. **Check progress against phases**: Regularly review which phase items have been completed

For each function or class being refactored, follow this micro-workflow:
1. Understand the current implementation
2. Plan the refactoring approach
3. Implement changes
4. Add/update documentation and type hints
5. Add/update tests
6. Verify functionality
7. Move to the next component
