# Module Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to refactor the module, addressing code quality, performance, functionality, and compliance with coding standards. Aim for files that no longer than approximately 700 lines of code (LOC) to ensure maintainability and readability.

## Checklist

### Functionality and Design Review
- [ ] Check that the module has all the functionality that an end end user could reasonably expect of such a module
- [ ] Review API design for intuitiveness and consistency
- [ ] Evaluate function naming for clarity and adherence to conventions
- [ ] Check if the module follows the principle of least surprise
- [ ] Identify any missing features or improvements needed

### Code Quality
- [ ] Analyze code for bugs and edge cases
- [ ] Check for code simplicity and readability
- [ ] Remove redundant or duplicated code
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling
- [ ] Review resource management (e.g., file handles, memory)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize critical paths for speed
- [ ] Check for memory leaks or excessive memory usage
- [ ] Review algorithm efficiency
- [ ] Consider parallelization opportunities where appropriate

### Documentation and Type Safety
- [ ] Add/update docstrings in numpydoc format
- [ ] Ensure all public functions and classes are documented
- [ ] Add comprehensive type hints to all functions and methods
- [ ] Remove any outdated or irrelevant comments
- [ ] Remove custom runtime type checking in favor of static type hints
- [ ] Ensure all functions have type hints for parameters and return values
- [ ] Implement beartype validation for all public-facing functions
- [ ] Document any complex algorithms or design decisions

### Testing
- [ ] Create/update unit tests for all functionality
- [ ] Ensure 100% test coverage across the module
- [ ] Verify all tests pass consistently
- [ ] Test edge cases and failure scenarios
- [ ] Use conftest.py for shared fixtures and configurations

### Linting and Static Analysis
- [ ] Run and resolve pylint issues
- [ ] Address pylance errors and warnings
- [ ] Fix mypy type checking issues
- [ ] Ensure compliance with project coding standards

### Final Review
- [ ] Conduct code review with team members
- [ ] Verify all checklist items are complete
- [ ] Create PR with detailed description of changes
- [ ] Update related documentation if necessary
